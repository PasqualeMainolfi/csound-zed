# Csound Zed Support

This Zed extension provides syntax highlighting, indentation, code folding, and parsing support for [Csound 7](https://github.com/csound/csound).  
It also includes autocompletion for opcodes and functions, automatically generated by parsing the [**official Csound manual**](https://github.com/csound/manual).
